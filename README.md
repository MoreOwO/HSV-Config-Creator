# HSV-Config-Creator
Just a program to create Hit Score Visualizer Configs

# How to use
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/MoreOwO/HSV-Config-Creator/releases/latest "latest releases"). Unzip it. Make sure the `Settings` folder is in the same directory as `HSV Configurator.exe` and run it.

# Folder Selection
To select your HSV directory, you need to click `Browse` and then, navigate inside the HSV directory in UserData (something like: `Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\UserData\HitScoreVisualizer`).

# Crashes, bugs and missing features
If a crash occurs, you can open a new issue with the content of `crash-report.txt` in `Settings\Logs`
